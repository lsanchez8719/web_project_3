              Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course,
              no one in their right mind
              would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some
              point. Summers are hot here, and
              the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture, all of it sprinkled with
              modified balconies. If you're
              on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those
              wearing heels. The left bank
              is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts
              of the right one.

              The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below from a rock that juts out into the sea. It
              is thought to have been
              built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on
              the Shores of Snowdonia has
              become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.

              A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's,
              whose secret ingredient is
              rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in
              Bloom award for five years
              in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the
              only Welshman ever to hold the
              office of Prime Minister of the UK.

              Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The town is surrounded by beautiful
              forests and countryside. It's
              known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping
              opportunities: shops with handmade
              jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a yearly festival
              celebrating "spoonbread", a local
              dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

              However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was founded in 1855 and was the
              first college in the south to
              be racially integrated, as well as the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no
              tuition — every student receives
              a full-tuition scholarship.

              Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era, Muramvya was the royal capital and
              in 2007, because of its
              cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located
              in the center of Burundi,

              The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think you're in heaven. At 2,665
              meters (8,743 ft) above sea
              level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of
              the largest plantations of
              tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.

              The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for apes, overlaps four provinces,
              including Muramvya. This National
              Park lies at the apex of the beautiful mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660
              meters of altitude. It is
              filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and streams which provide water
              around the country.

              billion dollars in
              damage and 3,057 deaths. The failure and inability to recover in the years after the storm has added to
