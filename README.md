**Intro**    
  
This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Technologies**
  In this project i used BEM to name classes, I also used  responsive Atributes such as media quaries among others to ensure correct display in most screen sizes, i also used  a combination flexbox as well grid template areas, in order to achieve propper allocation of elements in the project.   

**Figma**
All design specifacations where taken from the Figma Design available in the link below

**Images**  
  
All images were directly exported from the Figma design and were optimized with Photoshop and with [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/), in order to make the project load faster. 
  
Thanks,
